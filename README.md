Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?


Scenario: 
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
 
About the company:


In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a set of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Business Task :   How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Key Questions: 

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

How can Cyclists use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

What is the problem you are trying to solve?

After looking at the scenario and reading about the company data, our company goal is to grow further and sign up more annual members. For our company we get more profitable on annual membership compared to the casual riders. So Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will help future growth. Our main goal is to try to convert casual riders to members. 

How can your insights drive business decisions?

My insights can help drive business decisions by looking at the data in Excel and help find out how many people are casual riders and how many people are taking advantage of the annual program. We can also use SQL data to find out the exact number of people who use the program. And try to find out how many people are casual riders depending on the location and number of bikes used at individual stations.  


Prepare
You will use Cyclist's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Download the Cyclistic trip data here .(Note: Choose “202004-divvy-tripdata.zip Jun 1st 2020, 07:50:06 am” ) You can choose to work with an entire year of data, or just one quarter of a year. If you are working in Google Sheets, there are some less that might be too large to view. This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
